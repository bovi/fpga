# FPGA

Some activities regarding FPGA investigation

## General

1. Write HDL (e.g. Verilog)
2. Synthesis (with yosys)
3. Place and Route (with nextpnr)
4. Package (e.g. with icepack)
5. Upload (with iceprog)

## Lattice

Usage of the iCEstick Evaluation Kit ICE40HX1K-STICK-EVN

## TODOs

What are the next steps:
[x] identify interesting FPGA vendors
[ ] experiment with a selection of these vendors
[ ] investigate HDLs like Verilog and VHDL
[ ] investigate Open Source based FPGA toolchains
