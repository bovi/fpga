# FPGA

Some activities regarding FPGA investigation

## General

1. Write HDL (e.g. Verilog)
2. Synthesis (with yosys)
3. Place and Route (with nextpnr)
4. Package (e.g. with icepack)
5. Upload (with iceprog)

## Lattice

Usage of the iCEstick Evaluation Kit ICE40HX1K-STICK-EVN

## TODOs

What are the next steps:
- identify interesting FPGA vendors
- experiment with a selection of these vendors
- investigate HDLs like Verilog and VHDL
- investigate Open Source based FPGA toolchains
